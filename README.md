🌍 Global Capital Flow Monitor

A 13-Layer Macro Structure & Narrative Engine

“Markets are not random.
They are structure + liquidity + incentives + psychology interacting in motion.”

This project is a personal macro-structure engine designed to monitor:
	•	Global capital flow direction
	•	Policy bias & liquidity regime
	•	Credit stress conditions
	•	Market psychology & narrative alignment

It does NOT generate buy/sell signals.
It builds structural interpretation discipline.

🎯 Why This Project Exists

Most dashboards show data.

This engine interprets:
	1.	What moved?
	2.	Why did it move?
	3.	Was it expected?
	4.	Who benefits?
	5.	What regime are we in?
	6.	How does it propagate cross-asset?
	7.	What hidden risks exist?
	8.	What narrative is the market believing?
	9.	Is this short-term noise or structural shift?
	10.	Where might global capital flow next?

This is a structure-reading framework, not a prediction machine.

🧠 The 13 Strategic Filters

1️⃣ Market Regime Filter

Defines current market phase:
	•	Risk-On
	•	Risk-Off
	•	Transition / Mixed

Core inputs:
US10Y / DXY / VIX alignment

⸻

2️⃣ Liquidity Filter (Enhanced)

Combines:
	•	Price expectation signals
	•	Financial Conditions (FCI)
	•	Real Rates

Determines:
Liquidity Supportive / Fragile / Tight

⸻

3️⃣ Policy Filter (Macro-Δ Structure Engine)

Uses structural deltas:
	•	REAL_RATE
	•	FCI
	•	DXY
	•	US10Y

Creates:
	•	Policy Bias Score
	•	Structural Tightening / Easing Classification
	•	Price vs Structure comparison

This is a structure-first interpretation model.

⸻

4️⃣ Fed Plumbing Filter

Tracks:
	•	TGA
	•	RRP
	•	WALCL
	•	NET_LIQ

Detects:
Dollar system internal liquidity shifts.

⸻

4.2️⃣ High Yield Spread Filter (HY OAS)

Measures:
	•	Credit stress temperature

Low spread = calm
Widening spread = risk temperature rising

⸻

4.5️⃣ Credit Stress Filter (HYG vs LQD)

Detects:
Risk appetite inside credit markets.

Credit often leads equities.

⸻

5️⃣ Directional Signals

Separates:
Noise vs Meaningful Move

Prevents overinterpretation of small changes.

⸻

6️⃣ Cross-Asset Filter

Tracks propagation:

Example:
VIX ↑ → USD ↑ → EM pressure → commodities impact

Capital flow rarely moves in isolation.

⸻

7️⃣ Risk Exposure Filter

Identifies hidden second-order risk.

Example:
Oil ↑ → inflation impulse → rate repricing risk

⸻

8️⃣ Incentive Filter

Asks:
Who benefits?

Markets move where incentives align.

⸻

9️⃣ Cause Filter

Attempts structural cause detection from signal clustering.

⸻

🔟 Direction Filter

Magnitude-weighted movement classification.

⸻

1️⃣1️⃣ Timing Filter

Classifies signals by horizon:
	•	Short-term
	•	Medium-term
	•	Structural

⸻

1️⃣2️⃣ Structural Filter

Connects signals to:
	•	Dollar dominance
	•	Energy regime
	•	Growth cycle shifts

Macro regime layer.

⸻

1️⃣3️⃣ Narrative Engine (v2)

Final synthesis layer.

Inputs:
	•	Policy Bias (structure)
	•	Credit condition
	•	Liquidity
	•	Fear & Greed sentiment

Outputs:
	•	Market Phase
	•	Final Risk Posture (Increase / Hold / Defensive / Reduce)
	•	Narrative 1-liner

This layer attempts to bridge:

Data → Structure → Psychology → Capital Allocation Bias

⸻

⚙️ Data Sources
	•	FRED (REAL_RATE, FCI, HY OAS, Liquidity plumbing)
	•	ETF pricing (HYG, LQD)
	•	Macro pricing (US10Y, DXY, VIX, WTI, USDKRW)
	•	Sentiment proxy (Fear & Greed placeholder)
	•	External expectation layer (extendable)

All external layers are modular.

⸻

🧩 Architecture

Daily workflow:
	1.	Fetch macro data
	2.	Fetch liquidity data
	3.	Fetch credit spread data
	4.	Fetch FRED extras
	5.	Generate structured report
	6.	Commit snapshot

Output:
/reports/daily_report_YYYY-MM-DD.md

The engine is deterministic and reproducible.

⸻

🚫 What This Is NOT
	•	Not a trading bot
	•	Not a stock picker
	•	Not a prediction engine
	•	Not financial advice

It is a capital flow interpretation framework.

⸻

🔮 Future Expansion Roadmap

Planned upgrades:
	•	Expectation Shock Layer (true economic surprise scoring)
	•	Narrative vs Data divergence detector
	•	Capital Flow Allocation Model (sector rotation mapping)
	•	Regime persistence probability scoring
	•	Sentiment integration from alternative sources

Long-term goal:

Build a personal macro-structure intelligence system
capable of answering:

“If global capital is moving, where must it eventually land?”

⸻

📌 Philosophy Behind the System

Markets are not about guessing.

They are about:
	•	Regime recognition
	•	Incentive mapping
	•	Structure alignment
	•	Risk asymmetry

This engine trains the mind to think like a global strategist.

⸻

🧭 Author’s Intent

This project exists to develop:
	•	Macro structural literacy
	•	Capital flow awareness
	•	Regime transition detection
	•	Narrative skepticism

It is a thinking tool.

Not a profit tool.

⸻

✨ Final Note

Capital always flows somewhere.
Structure decides direction.
Liquidity decides speed.
Psychology decides volatility.

This monitor attempts to observe all three.
