🌍 Global Capital Flow Monitor
### Strategy & Capital Flow Research Initiative

---

🧠 Overview

Global Capital Flow Monitor is a rule-based macro strategy engine.

It is designed to interpret cross-asset capital flow dynamics and transform them into a structured daily strategist framework.

The system integrates:

- Interest Rate Structure
- USD Liquidity Conditions
- Volatility Regimes
- Credit Market Stress
- Policy Bias & Expectations
- Factor Sensitivity
- Style Rotation
- Sector Allocation Logic
- Execution Translation Layer

The objective is not prediction.

The objective is disciplined interpretation of market structure and risk allocation.

💡 Strategic Genesis

This project is not just a coding exercise; it is a synthesis of my professional journey and intellectual rigor. 

* **The "Plumbing" Perspective:** My time at **Bank of America (Global Market Operations)** allowed me to see beyond price charts. I witnessed the "hidden pipes" of the financial system—how liquidity actually moves through TGA, RRP, and collateral chains. This project translates that "plumbing" into code.
* **Cross-Border Intelligence:** Experience at **ICBC (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China)** provided a rare vantage point into the interplay between Eastern and Western capital flows. My fluency in **English and Chinese**, combined with a **Computer Science** background, enables me to parse multi-polar narratives that single-lens models often miss.
* **Algorithmic Discipline:** As a CS graduate, I view the global market as a complex, non-linear system. I developed this engine to eliminate human bias and emotional noise, focusing instead on the mathematical reality of capital allocation.

🏗 Core Framework Philosophy

Markets move in layers:

1. Structure (Policy & Liquidity)
2. Price Confirmation (Rates / USD / Volatility)
3. Credit Conditions
4. Risk Budget Construction
5. Volatility Adjustment
6. Style & Factor Tilt
7. Sector Allocation
8. Execution Translation (Company Traits)

This system replicates that hierarchy using rule-based macro logic.

It separates:

- Structural bias
- Price reaction
- Liquidity plumbing
- Risk appetite
- Capital positioning
- Execution interpretation

## System Architecture

Macro Data  
→ Regime Detection  
→ Liquidity & Policy Analysis  
→ Credit Monitoring  
→ Narrative Engine  
→ Risk Budget Calculation  
→ Volatility-Controlled Exposure  
→ Style Tilt  
→ Factor Layer  
→ Sector Allocation Engine  
→ Execution / Style Translation Layer
→ Correlation Break Monitoring
→ Scenario Framework
→ Decision Layer
→ Transmission Mapping

Each filter operates independently but feeds into a structured daily strategist report.

🆕 Strategic Translation Layer
 . Execution / Style Translation Layer
 - Preferred Company Traits
 - Avoided Company Traits
 - Environment-aware stock type guidance

🆕 Decision & Strategic Framing
. Executive Summary (3-Line Compression Layer)
- Decision Layer (So What?)
- Scenario Framework (Base / Bull / Bear)
- Transmission Map (Macro → Industry → Company)

---

📊 Sample Daily Output Snapshot
Executive Summary (3 Lines)
Risk Stance: HOLD (40%)

Sector Tilt:
Overweight: Staples, Health Care, Financials
Underweight: Technology, Real Estate

Execution Focus:
High FCF / Low leverage / Defensive bias

Scenario:
Base: Liquidity mixed
Bull: Liquidity recovery
Bear: Credit stress breakout

The output is not a trading signal.

It is a structured macro interpretation and risk allocation framework.

🎯 Differentiation

- Separation of structure vs price confirmation
- Liquidity plumbing integration (TGA / RRP)
- Risk Budget quantification
- Volatility-adjusted exposure model
- Macro → Style → Sector → Company translation
- Correlation break detection
- Execution-layer interpretation
- Scenario-driven strategist framing
- Regime-based capital allocation logic

This is not an indicator stack.

It is a capital flow hierarchy model.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Macro research portfolio
- Cross-asset regime monitoring
- Risk management experimentation
- Asset allocation framework development
- Interview demonstration for strategy / research roles

---

## Ongoing Development

Planned upgrades:

- Event-driven Cause Filter (Economic Calendar Integration)
- Structural Trend Overlay (PMI / 200DMA)
- Factor Momentum Scoring
- Cross-Asset Divergence Intensity Index
- Allocation backtesting module

## Strategic Philosophy

> "Capital flows reflect incentives. Incentives reflect structure. Structure reflects the architecture of the global system."

In a world filled with information overload, the greatest asset is not data, but **Interpretation.** I believe that understanding capital flow is the ultimate way to understand human civilization—how we allocate **risk, trust, and belief.** This monitor is my lifelong commitment to decoding that language. It is built to protect sovereignty over one's own decisions in an era of engineered narratives.
