🌍 Global Capital Flow Monitor
### Strategy & Capital Flow Research Initiative

---

🧠 Overview

Global Capital Flow Monitor is a rule-based macro strategy engine.

It is designed to interpret cross-asset capital flow dynamics and transform them into a structured daily strategist framework.

The system integrates:

- Interest Rate Structure
- USD Liquidity Conditions
- Volatility Regimes
- Credit Market Stress
- Policy Bias & Expectations
- Factor Sensitivity
- Style Rotation
- Sector Allocation Logic

The objective is not prediction.

The objective is disciplined interpretation of market structure and risk allocation.

💡 Strategic Genesis

This project is not just a coding exercise; it is a synthesis of my professional journey and intellectual rigor. 

* **The "Plumbing" Perspective:** My time at **Bank of America (Global Market Operations)** allowed me to see beyond price charts. I witnessed the "hidden pipes" of the financial system—how liquidity actually moves through TGA, RRP, and collateral chains. This project translates that "plumbing" into code.
* **Cross-Border Intelligence:** Experience at **ICBC (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China)** provided a rare vantage point into the interplay between Eastern and Western capital flows. My fluency in **English and Chinese**, combined with a **Computer Science** background, enables me to parse multi-polar narratives that single-lens models often miss.
* **Algorithmic Discipline:** As a CS graduate, I view the global market as a complex, non-linear system. I developed this engine to eliminate human bias and emotional noise, focusing instead on the mathematical reality of capital allocation.

🏗 Core Framework Philosophy

Markets move in layers:

1. Structure (Policy & Liquidity)
2. Price Confirmation (Rates / USD / Volatility)
3. Credit Conditions
4. Risk Budget Construction
5. Volatility Adjustment
6. Style & Factor Tilt
7. Sector Allocation

This system replicates that hierarchy using rule-based macro logic.

It separates:

- Structural bias
- Price reaction
- Liquidity plumbing
- Risk appetite
- Capital positioning

## System Architecture

Macro Data  
→ Regime Detection  
→ Liquidity & Policy Analysis  
→ Credit Monitoring  
→ Narrative Engine  
→ Risk Budget Calculation  
→ Volatility-Controlled Exposure  
→ Style Tilt  
→ Factor Layer  
→ Sector Allocation Engine  

Each filter operates independently but feeds into a structured daily strategist report.

## Implemented Strategy Layers (18 Filters)

1. Market Regime Detection  
2. Liquidity Structure (Enhanced)  
3. Policy Bias Analysis  
4. Fed Plumbing (TGA / RRP / Net Liquidity)  
5. High Yield Spread (HY OAS)  
6. Credit Stress (HYG vs LQD)  
7. Directional Signal Layer  
8. Cross-Asset Interaction  
9. Incentive Mapping  
10. Cause Filter  
11. Noise vs Signal Filter  
12. Timing Framework  
13. Structural Interpretation  
14. Narrative Engine (Risk Budget Model)  
15. Divergence Monitor  
16. Volatility-Controled Exposure  
17. Style Tilt (Growth / Value / Duration / Defensive)  
18. Sector Allocation Engine

📊 Sample Daily Output Snapshot
Phase: WAITING / RANGE
Policy Bias: EASING (Moderate)
Liquidity: Draining
Credit: Calm
Final Risk Action: HOLD
Risk Budget: 60
Recommended Exposure: 60%
Style Tilt: Growth Bias + Defensive Overlay

The output is not a trading signal.

It is a structured macro interpretation and risk allocation framework.

🎯 Differentiation

- Separation of structure vs price confirmation
- Liquidity plumbing integration (TGA / RRP)
- Risk Budget quantification
- Volatility-adjusted exposure model
- Macro → Factor → Sector translation
- Regime-based capital allocation logic

This is not an indicator stack.

It is a capital flow hierarchy model.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Macro research portfolio
- Cross-asset regime monitoring
- Risk management experimentation
- Asset allocation framework development
- Interview demonstration for strategy / research roles

---

## Ongoing Development

Planned upgrades:

- Event-driven Cause Filter (Economic Calendar Integration)
- Structural Trend Overlay (PMI / 200DMA)
- Factor Momentum Scoring
- Sector Relative Strength Model
- Allocation backtesting module

## Strategic Philosophy

> "Capital flows reflect incentives. Incentives reflect structure. Structure reflects the architecture of the global system."

In a world filled with information overload, the greatest asset is not data, but **Interpretation.** I believe that understanding capital flow is the ultimate way to understand human civilization—how we allocate **risk, trust, and belief.** This monitor is my lifelong commitment to decoding that language. It is built to protect sovereignty over one's own decisions in an era of engineered narratives.
