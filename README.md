🌍 Global Capital Flow Monitor
### Strategy & Capital Flow Research Initiative

---

🧠 Overview

Global Capital Flow Monitor is a rule-based macro strategy engine.

It is designed to interpret cross-asset capital flow dynamics and transform them into a structured daily strategist framework.

The system integrates:

- Interest Rate Structure
- USD Liquidity Conditions
- Volatility Regimes
- Credit Market Stress
- Policy Bias & Expectations
- Factor Sensitivity
- Style Rotation
- Sector Allocation Logic

The objective is not prediction.

The objective is disciplined interpretation of market structure and risk allocation.

🏗 Core Framework Philosophy

Markets move in layers:

1. Structure (Policy & Liquidity)
2. Price Confirmation (Rates / USD / Volatility)
3. Credit Conditions
4. Risk Budget Construction
5. Volatility Adjustment
6. Style & Factor Tilt
7. Sector Allocation

This system replicates that hierarchy using rule-based macro logic.

It separates:

- Structural bias
- Price reaction
- Liquidity plumbing
- Risk appetite
- Capital positioning

## System Architecture

Macro Data  
→ Regime Detection  
→ Liquidity & Policy Analysis  
→ Credit Monitoring  
→ Narrative Engine  
→ Risk Budget Calculation  
→ Volatility-Controlled Exposure  
→ Style Tilt  
→ Factor Layer  
→ Sector Allocation Engine  

Each filter operates independently but feeds into a structured daily strategist report.

## Implemented Strategy Layers (18 Filters)

1. Market Regime Detection  
2. Liquidity Structure (Enhanced)  
3. Policy Bias Analysis  
4. Fed Plumbing (TGA / RRP / Net Liquidity)  
5. High Yield Spread (HY OAS)  
6. Credit Stress (HYG vs LQD)  
7. Directional Signal Layer  
8. Cross-Asset Interaction  
9. Incentive Mapping  
10. Cause Filter  
11. Noise vs Signal Filter  
12. Timing Framework  
13. Structural Interpretation  
14. Narrative Engine (Risk Budget Model)  
15. Divergence Monitor  
16. Volatility-Controled Exposure  
17. Style Tilt (Growth / Value / Duration / Defensive)  
18. Sector Allocation Engine

📊 Sample Daily Output Snapshot
Phase: WAITING / RANGE
Policy Bias: EASING (Moderate)
Liquidity: Draining
Credit: Calm
Final Risk Action: HOLD
Risk Budget: 60
Recommended Exposure: 60%
Style Tilt: Growth Bias + Defensive Overlay

The output is not a trading signal.

It is a structured macro interpretation and risk allocation framework.

🎯 Differentiation

- Separation of structure vs price confirmation
- Liquidity plumbing integration (TGA / RRP)
- Risk Budget quantification
- Volatility-adjusted exposure model
- Macro → Factor → Sector translation
- Regime-based capital allocation logic

This is not an indicator stack.

It is a capital flow hierarchy model.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Macro research portfolio
- Cross-asset regime monitoring
- Risk management experimentation
- Asset allocation framework development
- Interview demonstration for strategy / research roles

---

## Ongoing Development

Planned upgrades:

- Event-driven Cause Filter (Economic Calendar Integration)
- Structural Trend Overlay (PMI / 200DMA)
- Factor Momentum Scoring
- Sector Relative Strength Model
- Allocation backtesting module

---

## Strategic Philosophy

Capital flows reflect incentives.  
Incentives reflect structure.  
Structure reflects the architecture of the global system.

Understanding capital flow is not just about markets.  
It is about understanding how the world allocates risk, trust, and belief.
